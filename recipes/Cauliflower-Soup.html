                <li>Rinse the cauliflower, then remove the stem and outer leaves. 
                    Chop the cauliflower into florets. Set aside. </li>
                <li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the 
                    onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent, then add

                    is tender.</li>
                <li>Using an immersion blender (or transfer in batches to a blender),
